1. The question I am trying to answer is: How does taxi usage in Chicago change from 2013 to 2023? To answer this question, I am going to be asking a series of sub-questions for each year, such as:
	1. How many different taxis were used? 
	2. What is the total number of miles traveled in taxis? 
	3. What is the total number of time spent in taxis?
	4. What are the p50, p90, and p99 values for average number of trips per taxi? 
	5. What is the average time, in minutes, between trips?  
	6. How long, on average, was each trip in minutes? 
	7. How long, on average, was each trip in miles? 
2. I believe that this question is worth answering because the years 2013 through 2023 align with the emergence of Uber (founded in 2009, IPO in 2019). Thus, I feel that this analysis will provide insight into Uber's impact on taxi usage, which has previously been the subject of debate: 
	1. [An Uber ethical dilemma: examining the social issues at stake](https://www-jstor-org.calpoly.idm.oclc.org/stable/43861010?seq=1)
	2. [Disruptive Change in the Taxi Business: The Case of Uber](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2130243492?accountid=10362&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals)
3. My hypothesis is that total usage will decline throughout the time period, but there will be a sharp decline in the late 2010s, as Uber became wildly popular. 
4. Dataset for analysis: [Taxi Trips (2013 - 2023)](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips-2013-2023-/wrvz-psew/about_data)
